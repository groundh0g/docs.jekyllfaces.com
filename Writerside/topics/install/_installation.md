# Installation

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Eleventy](https:11ty.dev) handle many tasks right out of the box. Ideally, they would both handle each task in exactly the same way, but that's not the case.

This section explains the few touch points where [JekyllFaces](https:jekyllfaces.com) has deviated from the norms of each to provide a consistent interface for creating your site. 

For more information on the rationale for deviating from each platform's built-in-support for certain features and tasks is further described in [Gotchas](_gotchas.md) and [Writing Compatible Markdown](writing-compatible-markdown.md).


## Deciding on a Tech

[JekyllFaces](https://jekyllfaces.com) supports both [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). The decision of which should be based solely on the tech stack that you'd like to use.

1. Jekyll uses Ruby. So you'll need to install the tools that [support the Ruby ecosystem](jekyll.md).
2. Eleventy uses Node/JS. So you'll need to install the tools that [support the JavaScript ecosystem](eleventy.md).


## Instructions

Detailed instructions for installing the supporting technologies can be found below:

* [Ruby (for Jekyll)](ruby-for-jekyll.md)
* [NodeJS (for Eleventy)](nodejs-for-eleventy.md)
* [Sass](sass.md)
* [Browser Sync](browser-sync.md)
