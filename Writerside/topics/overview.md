# Overview

If you're looking to create great static sites, possibly including a blog, book, or documentation, you've come to the right place.

## What is JekyllFaces?

Jekyll is great at managing blogs and static pages, but sometimes you want a little more interaction, or you want to present content other than a blog post or landing page. Thatâ€™s where JekyllFaces comes in.

It provides GitHub-Pages-friendly extensions to make managing content for your projects easier to promote and manage. This is important if you're using GitHub Pages' built-in support for Jekyll, where the whitelist of Jekyll plugins are limited to a finite set.

> NOTE: This documentation was created using JetBrain's Writerside IDE. A future release of JekyllFaces will attempt to use the same structure that Writerside uses for its markdown-based documentation content. 

### Eleventy

JekyllFaces also provides support for a Jekyll-like alternative&mdash;Eleventy. In essence, Eleventy (a.k.a. "11ty") is a Node.js implementation of Jekyll. If you're familiar with Jekyll, you'll be fluent in Eleventy in no time.

### Choosing

If you're new to both Jekyll and Eleventy, you can base your decision on which supporting technologies you'd prefer to use to build your static sites. Jekyll is based on the Ruby language, where Eleventy is based on JavaScript/TypeScript.
